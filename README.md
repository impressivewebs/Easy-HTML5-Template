# [Easy HTML5 Template](http://easyhtml5template.com)

Easy HTML5 Template is just a simple project I threw together to offer a less intimidating alternative to [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com). For big projects that require great performance and more features, I highly recommend you use HTML5 Boilerplate. But if you're a beginner who just wants something simple and easy to digest, this is the right template for you.
